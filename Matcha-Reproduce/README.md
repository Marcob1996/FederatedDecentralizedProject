## MATCHA Reproducing and Cleaning Code

In this folder, we fix the code from the MATCHA: Communication-Efficient Decentralized SGD code repository (CODE: https://github.com/JYWa/MATCHA, PAPER: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09435). Furthermore, we reproduce their results training Resnet to classify Cifar10 using a Decentralized Communicator. Major overhauls were necessary to accomplish this reproduction. Below we provide details on what dependencies are needed to use our code.
